[1mDescription[22m   This edition contains 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and its  
              sequel 'Through the Looking Glass'. It is illustrated throughout  
              by Sir John Tenniel, whose drawings for the books add so much to  
              the enjoyment of them. Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mad Hatter, 
              the Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen and the White Rabbit all make     
              their appearances, and are now familiar figures in writing,       
              conversation and idiom. So too, are Carroll's delightful verses   
              such as 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' and the inspired jargon of 
              that masterly Wordsworthian parody, 'The Jabberwocky'. AUTHOR:    
              Charles Lutwidge (27 January 1832 - 14 January 1898), better known
              by the pen name Lewis Carroll was an English author,              
              mathematician, logician, Anglican and photographer. His most      
              famous writings are 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and its    
              sequel 'Through the Looking Glass' as well as the poems 'The      
              Hunting of the Snark' and 'jabberwocky', all considered to be     
              within the genre of literary nonsense. His facility at word play, 
              logic, and fantasy has delighted audiences ranging from children  
              to the literary elite, and beyond this his work has become        
              embedded deeply in modern culture, directly influencing many      
              artists.
