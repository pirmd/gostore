It is illustrated throughout by Sir John Tenniel, whose drawings for the books add so much to the enjoyment of them. Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen and the White Rabbit all make their appearances, and are now familiar figures in writing, conversation and idiom. So too, are Carroll's delightful verses such as 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' and the inspired jargon of that masterly Wordsworthian parody, 'The Jabberwocky'.","ISBN":"9781853261183","Language":"en","Name":"Lewis Carroll - Alices Adventures in Wonderland  Through the Looking-glass.epub","PageCount":272,"PublishedDate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","Publisher":"Wordsworth Editions","Subject":["Fiction"],"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland \u0026 Through the Looking-glass","Type":"book/epub","UpdatedAt":"1976-01-17T05:42:05+01:00"}]
