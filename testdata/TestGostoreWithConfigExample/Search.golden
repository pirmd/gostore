[1mDescription[22m   This edition contains Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its    
              sequel Through the Looking Glass. It is illustrated throughout by 
              Sir John Tenniel, whose drawings for the books add so much to the 
              enjoyment of them. Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mad Hatter, the 
              Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen and the White Rabbit all make their   
              appearances, and are now familiar figures in writing, conversation
              and idiom. So too, are Carroll's delightful verses such as 'The   
              Walrus and the Carpenter' and the inspired jargon of that masterly
              Wordsworthian parody, 'The Jabberwocky'.
