[1mDescription[22m   Baron Munchausen is a fictional German nobleman created by the    
              German writer Rudolf Erich Raspe in his 1785 book Baron           
              Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in 
              Russia. The character is loosely based on a real baron, Hieronymus
              Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von MÔøΩnchhausenBorn in Bodenwerder,      
              Electorate of Brunswick-LÔøΩneburg, the real-life MÔøΩnchhausen fought
              for the Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735-1739. Upon
              retiring in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German       
              aristocratic circles for telling outrageous tall tales based on   
              his military career. After hearing some of MÔøΩnchhausen's stories, 
              Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German
              as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book,
              which was first published in Oxford by a bookseller named Smith.  
              The book was soon translated into other European languages,       
              including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August  
              BÔøΩrger. The real-life MÔøΩnchhausen was deeply upset at the         
              development of a fictional character bearing his name, and        
              threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps
              fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of  
              the work, which was only established posthumously.The fictional   
              Baron's exploits, narrated in the first person, focus on his      
              impossible achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller,   
              for instance riding on a cannonball, fighting a forty-foot        
              crocodile, and travelling to the Moon. Intentionally comedic, the 
              stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausen's   
              claims, and contain an undercurrent of social satire. The earliest
              illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, 
              depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later            
              illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the
              sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache that have become part of
              the character's definitive visual representation. Raspe's book was
              a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous
              English, continental European, and American editions that were    
              expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various  
              revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century,   
              especially in editions for young readers.Versions of the fictional
              Baron have appeared on stage, screen, radio, and television, as   
              well as in other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen      
              stories are no longer well-known in many English-speaking         
              countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The      
              character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several
              medical conditions and other concepts are named after him,        
              including Munchausen syndrome, the MÔøΩnchhausen trilemma, and      
              Munchausen numbers.We are delighted to publish this classic book  
              as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the  
              books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and   
              therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim 
              of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this   
              vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a      
              significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into 
              print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of    
              titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original 
              works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been      
              meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been   
              guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as   
              close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that 
              you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it   
              becomes an enriching experience.

[1mDescription[22m   This edition contains Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its    
              sequel Through the Looking Glass. It is illustrated throughout by 
              Sir John Tenniel, whose drawings for the books add so much to the 
              enjoyment of them. Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mad Hatter, the 
              Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen and the White Rabbit all make their   
              appearances, and are now familiar figures in writing, conversation
              and idiom. So too, are Carroll's delightful verses such as 'The   
              Walrus and the Carpenter' and the inspired jargon of that masterly
              Wordsworthian parody, 'The Jabberwocky'.
